Heart Failure Mortality Prediction with R & Tidymodels

Project Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 17.9 million deaths annually (31% of all global deaths). 
Heart failure, a severe consequence of CVDs, requires early prediction to improve patient outcomes.

In this project, we will develop a machine learning model to predict mortality due to heart failure using 12 clinical features. We will leverage R and the Tidymodels framework to build, evaluate, and optimize multiple models.

Key Insights

🔍 Identifying critical risk factors associated with heart failure mortality, such as serum creatinine and ejection fraction.

📊 Understanding the impact of creatinine phosphokinase ,serum creatinine,serum sodium and more.

Objectives

🔹 Explore and preprocess the dataset to ensure data quality.

🔹 Build and compare different machine learning models using Tidymodels in R.

🔹 Identify key risk factors influencing heart failure mortality.

🔹 Evaluate model performance using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and other relevant metrics.

Dataset & Methodology

📌 Dataset: Contains 12 features related to heart failure risk factors, including diabetes and serum creatinine levels.

📌 Machine Learning Framework: Tidymodels

📌 Models Used:

✅ Logistic Regression – A baseline model for binary classification.

✅ k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – A distance-based algorithm for classification.

✅ Random Forest – An ensemble model for robust predictions.

✅ Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) – A powerful boosting technique for improving performance.

✅ Support Vector Machines (SVM) – A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal decision boundary for classification by maximizing the margin between classes.

Why This Matters

Early detection of high-risk patients allows for timely medical intervention, ultimately reducing preventable deaths. By applying machine learning, we aim to enhance cardiovascular risk assessment and improve clinical decision-making.
